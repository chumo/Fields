Fields
======

This is a [D3](http://d3js.org/) web-app to experiment with a vectorial field. Place positive or negative charges and see what happens to the field. The mouse pointer is also a charge while hovering on the field.

You can try the web-app in the project site: [http://chumo.github.io/Fields/](http://chumo.github.io/Fields/).

Enjoy!
